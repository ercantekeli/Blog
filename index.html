            <h1 id="p-title">The 10 most beautiful quotes from “Le Petit Prince” to reflect on day after day</h1>
            1. "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”
            <br>
            2. “It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself
            rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
            <br>
            3. "What matters most are the simple pleasures so abundant that we can all enjoy them...Happiness doesn't
            lie in the objects we gather around us. To find it, all we need to do is open our eyes.”
            <br>
            4. “All men have stars, but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers,
            the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are
            scholars, they are problems... But all these stars are silent. You-You alone will have stars as no one else
            has them."
            <br>
            5. “Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the
            butterflies.”
            <br>
            6. “It's the time you spent on your rose that makes your rose so important...People have forgotten this
            truth, but you mustn't forget it. You become responsible forever for what you've tamed. You're responsible
            for your rose.”
            <br>
            7. “But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.”
            <br>
            8. “A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the
            image of a cathedral.”
            <br>
            9. “All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it.”
            <br>
            10. “The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart."
